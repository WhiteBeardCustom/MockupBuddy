### SmartScreen Warning (IMPORTANT)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why am I seeing this warning?**  
> Because MockupBuddy is provided **100% free of charge**, and **code-signing is an added expense that isn‚Äôt viable for most solo developers**, the installer is **not digitally signed**.

As a result, Windows Defender SmartScreen may block the installer the first time you run it.

To proceed safely:
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**
3. Follow the normal installation prompts


### Installation Steps
1. **Download** the installer via the provided Google Docs link.

## üé® Light/Dark Design Tagging ‚Äì Critical for Accurate Mockups

> üí° **IMPORTANT: Tag your design filenames correctly for best results!**

To ensure that each design is paired with the correct T-shirt mockup background, you **must include a tag in the filename**:

### ‚úÖ Accepted Naming Tags
- **`-Light`** ‚Üí for designs intended for **light-colored shirts**  
  _e.g., White, Aqua, Peach, Heather Yellow, etc._
- **`-Dark`** ‚Üí for designs intended for **dark-colored shirts**  
  _e.g., Black, Navy, Charcoal, Dark Heather Purple, etc._

**Examples:**
- `rocknroll-Light.png` ‚Üí used only with **light mockups**
- `skullart-Dark.png` ‚Üí used only with **dark mockups**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you don‚Äôt tag your files**, the design will be applied to **every mockup**, which may result in poor contrast and unreadable output.

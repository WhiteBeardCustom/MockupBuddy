## 🚀 Installation Guide

### System Requirements
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or higher (64-bit)
- **Memory**: 4 GB RAM or more
- **Disk Space**: ~200MB for installation
- **Python**: Not required — fully compiled executable

### SmartScreen Warning (IMPORTANT)

> ⚠️ **Why am I seeing this warning?**  
> Because MockupBuddy is provided **100% free of charge**, and **code-signing is an added expense that isn’t viable for most solo developers**, the installer is **not digitally signed**.

As a result, Windows Defender SmartScreen may block the installer the first time you run it.

To proceed safely:
1. Click **More info**
2. Click **Run anyway**
3. Follow the normal installation prompts

### Installation Steps
1. **Download** the installer via the provided Google Docs link.
2. **Double-click** the `MockupBuddy_Setup.exe` file.
3. Follow the prompts and **choose installation options**:

## 🎨 Light/Dark Design Tagging – Critical for Accurate Mockups

> 💡 **IMPORTANT: Tag your design filenames correctly for best results!**

To ensure that each design is paired with the correct T-shirt mockup background, you **must include a tag in the filename**:

### ✅ Accepted Naming Tags
- **`-Light`** → for designs intended for **light-colored shirts**  
  _e.g., White, Aqua, Peach, Heather Yellow, etc._
- **`-Dark`** → for designs intended for **dark-colored shirts**  
  _e.g., Black, Navy, Charcoal, Dark Heather Purple, etc._

**Examples:**
- `rocknroll-Light.png` → used only with **light mockups**
- `skullart-Dark.png` → used only with **dark mockups**

> ⚠️ **If you don’t tag your files**, the design will be applied to **every mockup**, which may result in poor contrast and unreadable output.
